i want to be able take images of the video and save them in a list that i can click on and jump to the position of the video that the image was taken from

I also need stying and the additional features you just mentioned added



Video Player functionality:
Add the ReactPlayer to the home page. 
You must be able to resive the player by moving a small handle to the bottom right of the player.
Implement a button that allows selecting a file to play.
Implement another button called "Screenshot". When the button is clicked, implement take images of the video and save them in a list that i can click on and jump to the position of the video that the image was taken from

Fix bugs encountered:
ReactPlayer component does not directly expose a getVideo method. Instead, we should be using the ref correctly to access the video element.
